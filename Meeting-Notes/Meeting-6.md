## 1. Review Minutes from Previous Meeting
The meeting focused on several key initiatives aimed at enhancing community engagement and funding for the LUKSO ecosystem. Ethalorian proposed a funding model for the Hacker House, suggesting a 50-25-25 split between the foundation, existing community projects, and external sources, while also exploring fundraising ideas such as community donations and the creation of a meme coin. Additionally, Jordy Dutch discussed his vision for transforming the Luksooverse website into an open-source ecosystem map, although he expressed concerns about managing it alongside other commitments. The need for community mobilization was emphasized, with discussions about the loosely formed LUKSO Builders Association (LBA) aimed at consolidating efforts.

Collaboration among key community figures was a recurring theme, with Marcus May and Sage Bray advocating for unity in promoting LUKSO's initiatives. Natasha Fawn supported the idea of consolidating efforts across different entities, highlighting the foundation's commitment to this mission. The group also considered a potential name change for the LUKSO Builders Association to maintain its brand identity. The meeting underscored a sense of optimism regarding the community's momentum and the potential for future collaborations, particularly in light of upcoming events and initiatives.

The team addressed logistical aspects, including the urgency of securing a venue for an upcoming event and brainstorming various fundraising strategies such as crowdfunding and merchandise sales. Ethalorian discussed the need for improved communication tools and the potential for a decentralized social conference in Berlin. The meeting concluded with plans for office hours to enhance developer engagement and a commitment to promote the next meeting scheduled for November 5th. Participants expressed appreciation for the collaborative spirit and commitment to advancing LUKSO's vision.
