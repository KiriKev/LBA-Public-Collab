## 1. Review Minutes from Previous Meeting
The discussion moved on to the need for approximately $15,000 in funding for upcoming projects. Various fundraising strategies were explored, including the potential launch of a meme coin to garner community support. Presto proposed an LBA Mint as a funding mechanism, which Ethalorian agreed with, noting that any surplus could go to a treasury for future projects. The group also talked about diversifying revenue sources beyond the foundation's support, with Ethalorian suggesting a tiered sponsorship model to attract contributions from different entities, including community and network partners.

The conversation shifted to strategies for attracting new developers and fostering a collaborative community. Ethalorian proposed a proof of participation model to boost engagement, while the group brainstormed fundraising ideas, including a 50-25-25 model for securing financial support. They discussed launching a meme coin on Solana, with an emphasis on ethical liquidity management strategies and the importance of maintaining flexibility in their plans. The meeting concluded with an agreement to reconvene the following Tuesday, emphasizing the importance of community involvement and collaboration to advance their projects.
