#### Public Coordination Repository

</br>

Welcome to the collaborative hub for the LUKSO Builders Association (LBA). This repository serves as a central location for notes, meeting records, and public coordination of our efforts and initiatives.

## About the LUKSO Builders Association

The LUKSO Builders Association is a voluntary collective of core community members united by a shared belief: the strength of a decentralized ecosystem lies in its participants. These participants span a wide spectrum, from basic token holders to protocol core developers.

We firmly believe that collaborative efforts can achieve outcomes that would be impossible through disconnected individual endeavors alone.

## Our Commitment to Transparency

In the spirit of fostering an open and inclusive community, we host public LBA meetings. The agendas, meeting notes, and recordings from these gatherings are posted in this repository. By embracing radical transparency, we aim to:

1. Broaden the scope of our conversations
2. Encourage diverse perspectives and inputs
3. Maintain accountability to our community
4. Facilitate easier onboarding for new participants

We invite you to explore this repository, engage with the content, and join us in shaping the future of the LUKSO ecosystem. Your involvement, whether big or small, contributes to the vibrant tapestry of our decentralized community.
